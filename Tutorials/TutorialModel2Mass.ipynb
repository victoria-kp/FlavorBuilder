    "It is a dictionary containing different features of the model. The \"particles\" key tells Model2Mass the symbols you want it to assign to the different particles. For instance, here it has: \n",

    "1. $L_i$ for $i = 1,2,3 $ which represent the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_{L}$ lepton doublets\n",

    "6. $\\phi_i$ 5 flavons which are neutral under the SM gauge group\n",
    "\n",

    "The \"representations\" key tells the representation in which each particle belongs. The ordering of the \"representations\" arrays should be the same as the one of \"particles\". In this case, A4 has four irreps. So, the first four entries of each array in the \"representations\" is a one-hot encoded vector that tells which irrep of A4 this particle belongs. The entries afterwards correspond to the ZN charge value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ZN dimension is specified in \"ZN_symmetries\" key. In this case, it corresponds to a Z4. This could in principle be an array with M numbers which would correspond to M $\\mathbb{Z}_{N_{i}}$ with $i=1, \\cdots, M$ finite abelain groups. \n",

    "The convention of the $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ charges $q$ such that the value of this charge ranges from 1 to N. The actual charge corresponds to $q-1$. So, for instance, the charge of the Lagrangian term $L_1 E_1 H_d$ should be\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, in this model, $L_{2}$ is a triplet under $A_{4}$ and has a charge of $1$ under $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, since $L_{2}$ is in a triplet, model2mass needs to know what are the other components of that triplet. The \"associations\" key in the dictionary model tells model2mass that information. Its dimension should be given by the number of non-flavon particles considered in the model.

    "2. non-zero value k, then ths particle belongs to a multiplet under the finite discrete group. All the particles with a value of k belong to the same multiplet\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the \"fixed_flavon_vevs\" key is an array with dimension equal to the number of flavons you included in the \"particles\" key. Each index corresponds to each flavon. The value for each entry indicates the desired vev. You can choose this convention. The default one is given by:\n",

The other keys in the model file dictionary can be obtained with model2mass. The \"param_dict\" key was obtained using FlavorPy and gives the $\\chi^2$ value in \"total_chisq\".\n",
    "\n",

    "1. \"particles\" keys which contains the names of the particles in the model.\n",

    "3. \"associations\" which contains what are the components of the multiplets for the non-flavon particles.\n",
